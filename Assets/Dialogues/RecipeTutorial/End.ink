It's actually super cursed. You shouldn't keep it open for too long.

I mean it, it has a demon in it. It will disembowel you.

Besides, this book only works if you KNOW WHAT THE RECIPE LOOKS LIKE.

Save it for emergencies! And remember, CLOSE THE BOOK as fast as you can when you're done using it!

You'll know you're running out of time if you see the demon peeping out at you...
